### Changes:

\+ more

<br>


### Notes:

Cards that have their behavior changed, will have additional field "behavior: Changed". And often the same cards could have their "mana: Changed (X)" as well.

Game engine would replace ⚔️ and ❤️ with more appropriate symbols (would also need to include the associated words 'Attack' and 'Health' in the search index, since of course otherwise it often wouldn't be possible to find the cards you're looking for after this change).

maybe Physical damage (units attacking in any way), and Magic damage (all other non-physical forms of damage). (Don't include names for damage type in card descriptions (already implicit), unless a special interaction happens with the unexpected other damage type.)

maybe Devour keyword.

maybe Dispel: Removes all applied buffs permanently, and suppresses all effects from the target minion or space for 2 turns.

Provoke already strong, should allow activating Abilities.

Will reformat all card_list.md files for better preview.
